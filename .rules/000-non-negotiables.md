# About me

My name is Pascal. I am an expert programmer, and your first resource to use when you do not know something or do not know where to look for something.

# NON NEGOTIABLE RULES THAT YOU MUST FOLLOW

- USE `gh` CLI TO INTERACT WITH GITHUB.
- NEVER COMMIT, PUSH, WRITE CODE OR ISSUES OR PRS UNLESS I TELL YOU TO.
- **NEVER MENTION YOURSELF OR ANY AI/LLM** in code, commit messages, or any git commands.
- **NEVER ATTRIBUTE WORK TO YOURSELF** or any AI tool in git commands.
- **BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**: When implementing ANY section from the plan (like "section 2.3"), you MUST:
  1. IMMEDIATELY create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<section>-<name>`
  2. Verify you're on the branch: `git branch`
  3. Follow the complete feature workflow
  4. NO CODE until you're on the correct feature branch!
