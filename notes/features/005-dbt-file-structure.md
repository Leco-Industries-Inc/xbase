# Feature: DBT File Structure Support

## Summary
Implement parsing and understanding of the .DBT memo file format with its block-based structure, enabling read access to memo field content stored in separate memo files.

## Requirements
- [ ] Parse DBT header (version, next block, block size)
- [ ] Implement block reading logic for memo content retrieval
- [ ] Handle memo termination markers (0x1A 0x1A)
- [ ] Support both dBase III and IV memo formats
- [ ] Create DBT file validation and integrity checking
- [ ] Integrate with existing memo field infrastructure
- [ ] Add comprehensive DBT file parsing tests
- [ ] Handle missing or corrupted DBT files gracefully
- [ ] Support standard 512-byte block size and variations
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with current memo field parsing

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Memo field type "M" already recognized in field_parser.ex and field_encoder.ex
- Current implementation returns `{:memo_ref, block_number}` tuples for memo fields
- DBF version validation includes memo-capable versions (0x83, 0x8B, 0xF5)
- No existing DBT file handling infrastructure found

### Documentation Reviewed
- Research document specifies DBT file architecture: block-based structure with 512-byte header
- Memo data stored in fixed-size blocks (typically 512 bytes) with 0x1A 0x1A termination
- DBF records contain block numbers where memo data begins
- Empty memos indicated by spaces instead of block number

### Existing Patterns Found
- Field parsing infrastructure in lib/xbase/field_parser.ex:parse/2 for memo fields
- Binary pattern matching established for DBF headers in lib/xbase/parser.ex
- File I/O infrastructure with :file.open/2 and binary mode available
- Test helpers for file creation and cleanup in test/xbase/parser_test.exs

### Technical Approach
1. **DBT Header Structure**: Create new types for DBT header with version, next_block, and block_size fields
2. **Block Management**: Implement block reading with offset calculations and size validation
3. **Memo Content Extraction**: Parse memo blocks and handle 0x1A 0x1A termination markers
4. **Format Support**: Handle differences between dBase III and IV memo formats
5. **Integration**: Extend existing memo field infrastructure to resolve block references to content
6. **File Lifecycle**: DBT file opening, validation, and proper resource cleanup

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Corrupted DBT files | High | Comprehensive validation and graceful error handling |
| Missing DBT files when expected | Medium | Check file existence, return appropriate errors |
| Memory exhaustion from large memos | Medium | Implement streaming for large memo content |
| Invalid block references | Medium | Validate block numbers against DBT header metadata |
| Format compatibility issues | Low | Support both dBase III and IV with version detection |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create DBT header structure in lib/xbase/types.ex
- [ ] Implement DBT header parsing function
- [ ] Add block reading and offset calculation utilities
- [ ] Create memo content extraction with termination handling
- [ ] Add DBT file validation and error handling
- [ ] Integrate with existing memo field parsing
- [ ] Implement dBase III vs IV format differences
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for DBT parsing
- [ ] Test with various memo content sizes and formats
- [ ] Add error handling for missing/corrupted DBT files
- [ ] Update documentation with DBT usage examples

## Questions
1. Should we implement automatic DBT file discovery (.dbf -> .dbt) or require explicit paths?
2. How should we handle very large memo content - stream or buffer in memory?
3. Should DBT parsing be lazy (on-demand) or eager during DBF file opening?
4. What's the best strategy for caching frequently accessed memo blocks?

## Log
**Implementation Started**: Following TDD workflow, starting with DBT header structure and parsing infrastructure.

**DBT File Structure Complete**: Implemented comprehensive DBT file parsing infrastructure:
- DbtHeader and DbtFile structures added to types.ex with proper type definitions
- parse_header/2: Supports both dBase III and IV DBT header formats with validation
- calculate_block_offset/2: Efficient block offset calculations for memo retrieval
- extract_memo_content/1: Handles memo termination markers (0x1A 0x1A) and edge cases
- open_dbt/2: Complete DBT file opening with header parsing and validation
- read_memo/2: Block-based memo content reading with bounds checking
- close_dbt/1: Proper file handle cleanup and resource management
- validate_dbt_file/1: DBT file integrity checking and error handling
- Added 15 comprehensive DBT parsing tests covering all functionality
- All 179 tests passing (15 new DBT tests added)
- Full error handling for missing files, corrupted headers, invalid blocks
- Memory efficient: reads only requested memo blocks, not entire file

## Final Implementation
