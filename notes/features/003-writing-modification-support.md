# Feature: Writing and Modification Support

## Summary
Add the ability to create new DBF files and modify existing ones, including writing records, updating fields, and managing the deletion flag to provide full read-write capability while maintaining format compatibility.

## Requirements
- [x] Implement create_dbf(path, fields) function
- [x] Generate proper header for new files
- [x] Write field descriptors with terminator
- [x] Initialize empty file with proper structure
- [x] Add version selection support
- [x] Implement append_record(dbf, data) function
- [x] Add update_record(dbf, index, data) function
- [x] Create field encoding for each data type
- [x] Ensure proper padding and alignment
- [x] Update header record count on append
- [x] Implement mark_deleted(dbf, index) function
- [x] Add undelete_record(dbf, index) function
- [x] Create pack/compact function to remove deleted records
- [ ] Implement deleted record counting
- [ ] Add batch deletion support
- [ ] Implement simple transaction wrapper
- [ ] Add rollback capability using file backup
- [ ] Create batch write operations
- [ ] Ensure header consistency after writes
- [ ] Add write conflict detection

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Phase 1 and 2 provide solid foundation with parsing and reading
- File I/O infrastructure with binary mode available
- Field parsing system established in FieldParser module

### Documentation Reviewed
- Research document specifies DBF write requirements
- Header structure: version, record count, lengths must be updated
- Field encoding: reverse of parsing (pad strings, format numbers, etc.)
- Record structure: deletion flag + field data
- File operations require proper header updates

### Existing Patterns Found
- `Xbase.Parser.open_dbf/1` provides file handle management pattern
- `Xbase.FieldParser.parse/2` shows field processing approach (need reverse)
- Binary pattern matching established for reading (need writing equivalent)
- Test infrastructure with DBF file creation helpers available

### Technical Approach
1. **Field Encoding**: Create reverse of FieldParser for encoding values to binary
2. **File Creation**: Generate proper headers and field descriptors
3. **Record Writing**: Binary construction with proper padding and alignment
4. **Header Updates**: Atomic updates to record count and file structure
5. **Transaction Support**: File copying for rollback capabilities
6. **Testing**: Extend existing test helpers for write operations

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| File corruption during writes | High | Transaction support with rollback, atomic operations |
| Header inconsistency | High | Validate all header updates, ensure atomicity |
| Field encoding errors | Medium | Comprehensive validation and testing |
| Concurrent access issues | Medium | Proper file locking, write conflict detection |

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Create FieldEncoder module (reverse of FieldParser)
- [x] Add create_dbf/2 function to Parser module
- [x] Implement append_record/2 function
- [x] Add update_record/3 function
- [x] Implement record deletion functions
- [x] Add header update utilities
- [ ] Create transaction wrapper module
- [ ] Implement file backup and rollback
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for all write operations
- [x] Test with various data types and edge cases
- [x] Verify header consistency after operations
- [ ] Performance testing for write operations

## Questions
1. Should we implement optimistic or pessimistic locking for concurrent access?
2. How should we handle partial writes and recovery from interruptions?

## Log
**Implementation Started**: Following TDD workflow, starting with FieldEncoder module (reverse of FieldParser).

**FieldEncoder Module Complete**: Created comprehensive field encoding with support for:
- Character fields (C): Proper padding and truncation
- Numeric fields (N): Integer and decimal encoding with right-alignment
- Date fields (D): YYYYMMDD format encoding
- Logical fields (L): T/F/? encoding
- Memo fields (M): Block reference encoding
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Round-trip testing with FieldParser (25 tests passing)

**create_dbf Function Complete**: Implemented complete DBF file creation:
- Field validation (names, types, lengths)
- Header generation with proper calculations
- Field descriptor binary construction
- File existence checking with overwrite option
- Version selection support
- All 5 new tests passing (75 total tests)

**append_record Function Complete**: Implemented full record appending:
- Encodes record data using FieldEncoder
- Calculates proper file offset for new records
- Updates header with incremented record count
- Updates header timestamp to current date
- Handles missing fields with appropriate defaults
- Validates field values before encoding
- Supports string truncation for oversized values
- All 7 new tests passing (82 total tests)

**update_record Function Complete**: Implemented full record updating:
- Updates existing records at specified index
- Merges update data with existing record data (partial updates)
- Preserves deletion flag from original record
- Validates record index before updating
- Updates header timestamp without changing record count
- Handles field validation and string truncation
- Supports updating multiple records independently
- All 8 new tests passing (90 total tests)

**Record Deletion Functions Complete**: Implemented mark_deleted and undelete_record:
- mark_deleted: Marks records as deleted by setting deletion flag (0x2A)
- undelete_record: Restores deleted records by clearing deletion flag (0x20)  
- Both functions validate record index before operation
- Updates header timestamp on deletion/undeletion
- Deleted records excluded from read_records output but data preserved
- Supports idempotent operations (can delete already deleted records)
- Full delete/undelete cycle maintains data integrity
- All 12 new tests passing (102 total tests)

**Pack/Compact Function Complete**: Implemented pack function to remove deleted records:
- Collects all non-deleted records from source file
- Creates new compacted file with only active records
- Updates header with correct record count and calculations
- Preserves field structure and data types exactly
- Handles edge cases: empty files, all-deleted files, no-deleted files
- Supports in-place packing or creating new file at different location
- Physically reclaims disk space by removing deleted record storage
- All 7 new tests passing (109 total tests)
