# Feature: Memo Integration

## Summary
Complete the memo field support by integrating memo writing with DBF record operations. Provides seamless memo content handling in record writing functions while maintaining transaction safety and backward compatibility.

## Requirements
- [ ] Extend DBF record writing to handle memo content automatically
- [ ] Implement coordinated DBF/DBT file operations
- [ ] Add transaction safety for memo operations
- [ ] Create high-level memo integration API
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing memo reference handling

## Research Summary
### Current State
- **Phase 5.1**: Complete DBT file parsing infrastructure ✅
- **Phase 5.2**: Memo reading integration with record parsing ✅  
- **Phase 5.3**: Complete memo writing capabilities ✅
- **Current Gap**: No integration between DBF record writing and memo content

### Existing Infrastructure Leveraged
- **FieldEncoder**: Already handles `{:memo_ref, block_number}` encoding
- **Record Writing**: `append_record/2`, `update_record/3` with transaction support
- **DbtWriter**: Complete memo writing, updating, deletion, compaction
- **Transaction System**: Existing backup/rollback capability for DBF files

### Integration Architecture
1. **Automatic Memo Detection**: Detect memo fields in record data during writing
2. **Coordinated File Operations**: Open and manage both DBF and DBT files together  
3. **Transparent Content Handling**: Convert memo content to block references automatically
4. **Extended Transaction Support**: Backup and rollback both DBF and DBT files
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing memo reference handling continues to work

## Technical Approach
1. **Create MemoHandler module** for coordinated DBF/DBT operations
2. **Extend Parser module** with memo-aware record writing functions
3. **Enhance transaction system** to handle both file types
4. **Add automatic memo file discovery** (.dbf → .dbt)
5. **Implement memo content validation** and error handling
6. **Create integration test suite** covering all scenarios

## Implementation Checklist
### 5.4.1 Memo Handler Infrastructure
- [ ] Create MemoHandler module for coordinated operations
- [ ] Implement open_dbf_with_memo/2 for coordinated file access
- [ ] Add automatic DBT file discovery and creation
- [ ] Create close_memo_files/1 for proper resource cleanup

### 5.4.2 Record Writing Enhancement
- [ ] Extend append_record/2 to handle memo content
- [ ] Add update_record/3 memo content support
- [ ] Implement automatic memo field detection
- [ ] Create memo content to block reference conversion

### 5.4.3 Transaction Integration
- [ ] Extend transaction system for DBF+DBT files
- [ ] Implement coordinated backup/rollback
- [ ] Add memo_transaction/2 wrapper function
- [ ] Ensure atomic operations across both files

### 5.4.4 Error Handling & Validation
- [ ] Add coordinated error handling
- [ ] Implement memo content validation
- [ ] Create meaningful error messages
- [ ] Handle missing DBT files gracefully

### 5.4.5 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test memo content in record operations
- [ ] Verify transaction safety
- [ ] Test backward compatibility
- [ ] Performance testing with large memo content

## Questions
1. Should memo content be automatically written on record append, or require explicit memo operations?
2. How should we handle memo content updates - reuse blocks or allocate new ones?
3. What's the best strategy for memo file discovery (.dbf → .dbt)?
4. Should the integration be opt-in or automatic for all memo fields?

## Log
**Research Started**: Following feature workflow, researching Phase 5.4 requirements and integration patterns.

**Research Complete**: Identified clear architecture for seamless memo integration. Phase 5.3 provides complete writing foundation. Need to bridge DBF record operations with memo content handling while maintaining existing patterns and transaction safety.
